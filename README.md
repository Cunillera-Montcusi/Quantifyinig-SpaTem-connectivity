1. The growing interest of spatiotemporal patterns in nature has been fostered by the current availability of high frequency tools. However, we still lack a methodological framework to process and interpret spatiotemporal datasets into meaningful values, adaptable to different time-windows and/or responding to different spatial structures. Here we developed and tested a framework to evaluate how communities are connected spatiotemporally by generating the Spatiotemporal connectivity (STcon) and the Spatiotemporal connectivity matrix (STconmat) measures.
2. Both spatiotemporal connectivity measures summarise spatial and temporal links of a defined system that is represented as a network of connected sites. These measures are calculated from a spatiotemporal matrix where spatial and temporal connections across sites are defined. These connections respond to a determined network structure and assign different weights to the links and no-links to generate different scenarios from which we obtain the spatiotemporal connectivity. We developed these measures by using a dataset of flow intermittence along a 513-day period obtained from data loggers installed across 7 temporary streams. Once obtained, these two measures allowed us to characterize the monitored streams and relate spatiotemporal patterns with macroinvertebrate community structure and composition.
3. Spatiotemporal connectivity differed within and among streams with STcon and STconmat capturing hydrological patterns. Macroinvertebrate richness and diversity were higher in more spatiotemporally connected sites. Community dissimilarity was related to STconmat showing that more spatiotemporally connected sites had similar communities for active dispersers and more hydrologically isolated sites had more different communities for active and passive dispersers. Interestingly, both dispersal groups were related with spatiotemporal connectivity pattens of some of the analysed scenarios, highlighting the relevance of spatiotemporal connectivity in highly dynamic systems. 
4. The proposed framework is not limited to this study case as it can be extended to other ecosystems, include different time windows, or consider different network structures to assess spatiotemporal patterns. Therefore, it can help to disentangle and quantify spatiotemporal dynamics or be applied in conservation of dynamic systems. Therefore, such approximation framed within meta-system theory is especially relevant in a context of global change, with spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystems being heavily disrupted by human activities.
